<h2>
Step 1: Sanitizing the Equipment</h2>

<p>Keeping your equipment sanitized is critical to brewing good beer at home. A slight contamination of fermenting or finished beer can ruin a perfectly good batch.
Anything that comes in contact with your wort or beer after it has been boiled should be both washed and sanitized. Any piece of brewing equipment that is used prior to boiling
does not need to be sanitized because the boiling stage will kill any germs or bacteria.<br>
<br>
To properly sanitize your equipment start by thoroughly washing each item with a mild anti-bacterial dish detergent. Use a scrubbing brush or sponge to help remove mineral deposits.
After washing the equipment, it needs to be immersed or washed in a sanitizing agent. There are several different home cleaning agents that are safe to use as a sanitizer.
These include: Bleach, iodophor, Star San, and B-brite.<br>
<br>
In case you are unsure which items need to be sanitized here is a list: the fermentor, mash tun, hot liquor tank, siphoning equipment, spoons, hydrometers, and tubing.   
</p>



<h2>Step 2: Brewing the Beer</h2>

<p>This is where it gets really fun and interesting. In all grain brewing recipes there are three main ingredients for making awesome beer.
From most to least important they are: <em>Water, Grains, and Hops</em>. Having good quality water is the most important thing. 
If your water source does not taste good, neither will the beer. If this is the case, I recommend buying some spring or drinking water from your local store.<br>
<br>
Next is the grains. These are the "backbone" of every batch of beer because it gives the beer most of its flavor and appearance. 
The grain provides the the simple and complex sugars which leave residual sweetness and other flavors in the brew.<br>
<br>
The final ingredient is the hops. The hops used in brewing are actually the flower from the hop plant (a member of the hemp family).
Most homebrewers that purchase their hops in a brewing or all grain kit will get them in a compressed pellet form.
Hops are what gives beer its bitterness or "hoppy" flavor as it is sometimes said by brewers.<br>
<br>
Now that we understand the basic ingredients of beer, we can talk about the actual process... <em>don't worry</em>, this is quick and easy.<br>
Fill up your boiling kettle with the correct amount of water for your recipe (usually 3-5 gallons). Heat the water until it gets to the correct temperature, then turn off the heat, and add the grains. This is called the mash. You will need to stir the mixture about every 15 minutes for one hour and make sure the mixture stays at temperature (check your recipe for the correct range).<br>
<br>
Next, you need to separate the liquid from the grains. If your boiling kettle has a built in strainer, you can just drain the liquid into another container for the next phase. If not, you will need to use a your own strainer. If you are doing this it helps to have an assistant.
Once the liquid is separated from the grains it is called the wort (pronounced wert). You need to boil the wort for about an hour and add the hops as the recipe calls for them. Sometimes you will have more than one type or add different fractions of the total at certain time increments. Make sure to follow the recipe instructions carefully.<br>
<br>
With this step complete, you are ready to chill the wort down to 70 degrees and prepare to transfer it to the fermentor.  
 
</p>

<h2>Step 3: 

Setting Up the Fermentor</h2>

<p>Now that your wort has been chilled, it's time to ferment. You need to make sure the fermentor has been rinsed and sanitized before proceeding. Once the fermentor is clean, you simply need to transfer the wort into the container and add the yeast packet that came with your ingredients.<br>
<br>
Move the fermentor to a dark room before conntinuing on. Make sure the lid fits on top of the fermentor and is air-tight. Insert one end of some sanitized tubing into the air hole in the fermentor cap and submerge the other end into a bowl of sanitized water to allow your beer to blow off gas. Congratulations, you just completed your first brew day. 
Go enjoy a cold one and don't forget to seal the air hole in about three days!
