<h1>Week Five Web Page</h1>
<h2>Best Six Images:</h2>
<p><img src="images/facebook-900w.jpg" alt="Facebook Logo" title="facebook" width ="500" height ="300"><br>
<br>
Out of the choices, this file is the smallest; all the images maintained the same quality.

<p><img src="images/inkscape-900w.gif" alt="Inkscape Logo" title="inkscape" width ="400" height ="300"><br>
<br>
For this image, I picked the gif file because the edges of the graphic are sharper. It's also only slightly larger than the png file and looks better.

<p><img src="images/jello-900w.png" alt="Jello Clip Art" title="jello" width ="500" height ="400"><br>
<br>
The jello image also looks best as a gif. The colors are richer but the file size is slightly larger than the png. However, the graphic lines look better and there is less distortion.

<p><img src="images/sheridan-900w.png" alt="Sheridan Street" title="mainstreet" width ="800" height ="350"><br>
<br>
This image is tricky. The original file is a png and so is my modified file. I was able to reduce the size down to less than a quarter of the original without sacrificing quality. 
Switching to jpg or gif blew out the sky and made street signs blurry at most file sizes.

<p><img src="images/student-life-900w.jpg" alt="Sheridan Students" title="students" width ="800" height ="400"><br>
<br>
The starting image file must have been badly optimized. After resizing and compressing the file in jpg format, the colors and resolution improved. The file size is also smaller than the gif and png.

<p><img src="images/watermellon-900w.gif" alt="Watermellon Clip Art" title="watermellon" width ="400" height ="300"><br>
<br>
This image looks best as a gif because of less distortion. Additionally, the file size is smaller.
